    <p class="dotted">
        Grand Theft Auto VI is an upcoming action-adventure game developed and published by Rockstar Games. It is due to be the eighth main Grand Theft Auto game, following Grand Theft Auto V (2013), and the sixteenth entry overall. Set within an open world—the fictional U.S. state of Leonida, based on Florida, and its Miami-inspired Vice City—the story follows the criminal duo of Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos.

Following years of speculation and anticipation, Rockstar confirmed in February 2022 that the game was in development. That September, footage from unfinished versions was leaked on the internet in what journalists described as one of the biggest leaks in the history of the video game industry. The game was formally revealed in December 2023 and is scheduled to be released on 26 May 2026 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

        Grand Theft Auto VI is an action-adventure game set within an open world. Its fictional U.S. state of Leonida—based on Florida—includes Vice City,[a] Grassrivers, and the Leonida Keys, based on Miami, the Everglades, and the Florida Keys, respectively; as well as Ambrosia, Mount Kalaga National Park, and Port Gellhorn.[6][7][8] The game world parodies 2020s American culture, with satirical depictions of social media and influencer culture, and references to internet memes such as Florida Man.

The story follows a criminal duo: Jason Duval, who worked for local drugrunners after his time in the Army; and Lucia Caminos, the series's first non-optional female protagonist,[b] who was imprisoned at Leonida Penitentiary after fighting for her family in Liberty City.[18] Following a failed bank robbery, they encounter a state-wide conspiracy and are forced to protect each other.[19] Other characters include: Cal Hampton, Jason's paranoid friend; Boobie Ike, who runs a business empire in Vice City; Dre'Quan Priest, owner of the record label Only Raw Records with Boobie; Bae-Luxe and Roxy, a musical duo signed to Only Raw as Real Dimez; Raul Bautista, a seasoned bank robber; and Brian Heder, a drugrunner and Jason's landlord.
