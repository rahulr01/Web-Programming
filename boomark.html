    <p>The Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro are a pair of Android smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Google as
        part of the Google Pixel product line. They serve as the successor to the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, respectively.
        The phones were first previewed in May 2022, during the Google I/O keynote. They are powered by the
        second-generation Google Tensor chip, and feature a design similar to that of the Pixel 6 series. They shipped
        with Android 13. The Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro were officially announced on October 6, 2022, at the annual Made by
        Google event, and were released in the United States on October 13. They were succeeded by the Pixel 8 and Pixel
        8 Pro in 2023.he Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro were previewed by Google on May 11, 2022, during the 2022 Google I/O
        keynote. During the keynote, the company confirmed that the phones would feature the second-generation Google
        Tensor system-on-chip (SoC),[5] which had been in development by October 2021.[6] The phones were approved by
        the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in August 2022. Google officially announced the phones on October
        6, 2022, alongside the Pixel Watch smartwatch, at the annual Made by Google event,[8] and became available in 17
        countries on October 13. A portion of the phones were manufactured by Foxconn in Vietnam, shifting production
        from southern China.Google requested approximately eight million Pixel 7 units from suppliers, with the goal of
        increasing its sales numbers twofold. During the launch event, Google also announced the phones' official cases,
        which became available for pre-order on the same day with three color options for each phone. Pre-orders for the
        phones began on the same day as the announcement.

        but the former was later increased to five years, with support extending to 2027.In addition to enhancements to
        Night Sight and Real Tone, camera features introduced on the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro include Guided Frame, Photo
        Unblur, and Cinematic Blur. A macro photography mode is also available on the Pixel 7 Pro to accompany its
        additional telephoto lens, as are upgrades to Super Res Zoom. The Direct My Call feature and Recorder app both
        received performance upgrades,[18] while Google announced that its VPN service from Google One would be bundled
        with the Pixel 7 series at no additional charge.

        The Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro only run apps that have 64-bit binaries, the first Android smartphones with such a
        restriction. As part of a partnership with Google, Snapchat and TikTok announced support for 10-bit HDR video on
        the Pixel 7 series.The Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro shipped with Android 13 and version 8.7 of the Google Camera app

        Google carries over the unique design language of last year's Pixel 6 for this year's Pixel 7. Most notably,
        it retains the horizontal camera bar on the back of the phone. In a world where Samsung uses a vertical
        camera array and Apple rolls with a square, Google's elongated bar stands out. In the case of the Pixel 7,
        there are two lenses tucked into the camera module, which has a matte aluminum cover rather than the black
        glass of the outgoing model. The phone is available in three colors: Lemongrass, Obsidian, or Snow. The
        frame is made from recycled aluminum. The front and back glass of the phone is glossy, though it doesn't
        seem to attract fingerprints. The screen measures 6.3 inches (0.1-inch smaller than the Pixel 6) with a
        punch-hole camera and nearly edge-to-edge bezels. The OLED display packs 2,400 by 1,080 pixels, for a
        density of 416ppi. The refresh rate runs as high as 90Hz, which isn't as fast as the 120Hz display on the
        Galaxy S22 or Pixel 7 Pro, but it's still noticeably smoother than a 60Hz display. The screen pushes up to
        1,000 nits (typical) and 1,400 nits (peak) of brightness, which matches Apple's iPhone 14 Pro. Contrast is
        one million to one, and there's support for 24-bit color and HDR. For comparison, the S22's screen measures
        6.1 inches and has a similar resolution, but steps up the refresh rate to 120Hz.
        <br>
        For $599, Google's Pixel 7 sits comfortably between the $449 Pixel 6a and the $899 Pixel 7 Pro in the
        company's lineup, which is the sweet spot in the budgets of many smartphone shoppersâ€”and that just so
        happens to make it one of the most feature-rich, affordable phones on the market. The Pixel 7 easily
        outclasses most similarly priced handsets, and brings some real heat to Samsung's $799 Galaxy S22, with
        standout performance and camera quality for the price. Though its low-key external design refresh and minor
        spec bump may seem a bit incremental year over year, you simply won't find a better Android phone for $600,
        making the Pixel 7 our Editors' Choice winner for affordable flagships.
        <br>
        But it's not a phone that should be observed in a vacuum alone. The Google Pixel 7 acts as a landmark
        juxtaposition to the iPhone 14, which also didn't score an exciting amount of improvements and upgrades over
        the previous iPhone 13 generation. Yet, if Apple can get a pass for that, it only seems fair that Google
        does as well. On the other hand, there's the Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S23+, which are Samsung's excellent
        offerings that boast slightly richer feature sets and comparable hardware in the same size segment.s

        There are significant disadvantages tho. It's just been a week so maybe the adaptive battery is taking it's
        time to, well, adapt to my usage (many other posts ask me to wait for 2 weeks to check my battery discharge
        rate as the software is adapting to my usage) but yea, the battery is shite. For no reason it uses more
        charge steadily. Like say I've been browsing reddit for 10 mins and then watch a movie with medium
        brightness and full volume, the discharge rate is the same! So idk what's up with the battery, but yea I was
        fully aware before buying the phone but ugh it's a pain in the ass coz the phone struggles to get me through
        the day with 1 full charge. On an average continuous use for hours, it discharges roughly at 10% per hour. I
        have 90hz on and mostly phone is on 5g all the time. Haven't got around to optimizing it. And charging takes
        time. It takes an hour if u use the Google charger or smtg similar. Charging speed and battery life is a
        major, major issue. And in other parts of India where it is more hot (35-40 degrees Celsius), the phone gets
        quite hot to touch. And the fingerprint sensor sucks. Face unlock is good enough, works 80% of the time. So
        if u guys want a pixel experience like I did, keep these issues in mind. I would prefer the OnePlus, Samsung
        phones for the battery life and the overall service support. My sister has OnePlus 11r and it charges in
        like half hour, lasts easily 1 and a half day. I took pixel coz ive been using samsung for a long time and
        wanted a change, and don't prefer OnePlus, Vivo etc.The phone is not amazing, but it's very good. Coming
        from a previous Samsung flagship S series user, I can tell the following:
        <br>
        1-Screen is relatively dim, I have struggled in direct sunlight and while driving and using this phone for
        navigation. A 90Hz screen is not a noticeable drawback here, it does well for me.
        2- Processor is good, it's fast enough for an average or even an above average user. It does frequently
        overheat when using the camera a lot, making phone calls and using mobile data, especially 5G.
        3- Camera, in a one word description, is amazing. It takes amazing shots, automatically processes images
        into even nice photos and video shooting is very good as well. However, if you use it a lot or shoot videos
        for more than 5-10 mins, the phone will heat up.
        4- Battery, in short, will not get you through the day if you're an average or above average user. Switch
        network to 5G and it would definitely not get you through the day.
        <br>
        The software is amazing with tons of features. Adaptive charging, adaptive connectivity, and more small but
        thoughtful features that I don't remember exactly. The camera is also really good and takes photos close to
        the similarly priced iPhone. 5G connectivity is good and I get 500 Mbps both in Airtel and Jio. Software is
        clean with no bloatware, and the phone is fast and my product has less heat issues (it's usually cool, gets
        warm during video call, long phone use, during charging).
